<h2>Description: </h2>
In this project, I will be using nmap to find any open ports on my network. I will be finding both TCP/UDP ports on the system and see if they are susceptible for an attack. The goal of this project, is to demonstrate how I was able to use nmap to identify any vulnerabilities and exploit the vulnerability.

<h2>Walkthrough: </h2>

<h3>Host enumeration and Network Mapping</h3>

<p>
  
  First, I will be checking how many devices are connected to my network. I can do this by typing `nmap -PR -sn 192.168.56.102/24` and this will check a total of 254 hosts in my network. The reason I used
  `-PR` and `-sn` is to search for any network devices that are alive. This is using a ARP request which just sends out packets to each device and see if they exist. If they do it will respond back with their 
  IP address. Now that I have a list of IP addresses I can save them all in file to perform a nmap scan.

<h3>Searching for any TCP ports [open]</h3>

<p>

  Now I can check if there are any TCP ports open in any of these networks. I can type `nmap -iL iplist.txt` which will show all the available ports open on this network. As I can see there are two host that have open ports `192.168.56.1` and `192.168.56.122`. I will be focusing on `192.168.56.122` since that has an open http port that I can look into.

<h3>Checking for any outdated versions</h3>

<p>

  I will be using the `-sV` option which will let me check if there are any outdated versions on a system.
