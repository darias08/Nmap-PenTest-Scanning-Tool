<h2>Description: </h2>
Nmap is a powerful networking scanning tool that can be used to identify any ports open on the network. This tool is very versatile, meaning it could be used from as an offensive or defensive perspective. Defenders can use this tool to better secure their network and find any ports that should or shouldn't be open. Attackers might use it to find any ports that are open and exploit any vulnerable ports that could potentially help them steal their data. I will be explaining the most common ways to use Nmap and how it has helped me to improve keeping my network secured from attackers.


<h2>Walkthrough: </h2>

<h3>Host enumeration and Network Mapping</h3>

<p>
  
  First, I will be checking how many devices are connected to my network. I can do this by typing `nmap -PR -sn 192.168.56.102/24` and this will check a total of 254 hosts in my network. The reason I used
  `-PR` and `-sn` is to search for any network devices that are alive. This is using an ARP request which just sends out packets to each device and sees if they exist. If they do, it will respond back with their 
  IP address. Now that I have a list of IP addresses I can save them all in a file to perform a Nmap scan.

<h3>Searching for any TCP ports [open]</h3>

<p>

  Now I can check if there are any TCP ports open in any of these networks. I can type `nmap -iL iplist.txt` which will show me any ports open on those IP addresses. As I can see, there are two hosts that have open ports `192.168.56.1` and `192.168.56.129`. I can see that there is an SSH port open which could possibly be easy to hack into if the password and username have common usernames/passwords that most people use. I can also see port `80` is open on `192.168.56.129` which I could visit and see if there are any vulnerabilities there.

</p>

<h3>Searching for any UDP ports [open]</h3>

<p>

  I can also check if there are any UDP ports open in any of these network devices. I can do that by typing `sudo nmap -sU -iL iplist.txt` which will show me all the UDP ports. I can see there is only one IP address that has a list of UPD ports, but there are only two that are open and the rest are `open | filtered` which could mean it is being blocked by a firewall. I could look more deeper in this and find if any of these UDP ports that are open are exploitable, but I just want to show how UDP can be used to find any vulnerabilities.

</p>


<h3>Checking for outdated versions</h3>

<p>

  This I believe is the most effective way to know if a machine or system is vulnerable because I can type `nmap -sV 192.168.56.129` and this will give me a list of versions based on their services. I can check if there are any outdated versions
  that are still running on this IP address. I can use `exploit db` which is a database that has a plethora of exploits and it can tell me how to exploit that vulnerability. As an example, I can see there is an Apache web server running on version `2.4.38` I can search this in the `exploit db` and find any exploits with this version.

<h3>OS Detection</h3>

<p>

  You can also see what kind of operating system is running on that IP device. This can be useful for several reasons, such as: network inventory, support/patching, discovering unauthorized devices, and many more... 
  OS detection is enabled with the option `"-O"` and another useful option that can go with that is `"-v"` which stands for verbose. In this IP address of `192.168.56.129` I can see this system is running on Linux.
  I can use this to verify if I know this IP address and I know I have that operating system on my network. So this can be a good way to verify what kind of operating systems are connected to your network and how many
  you know exist.

<h3>Firewall Evasion</h3>

<p>

 There are some instances when a Firewall might be implemented on a website or a Windows computer which could be a problem because you will not get a response back when you do a Nmap scan. The best solution to get around this firewall
 is to use `-Pn`, which tells Nmap to not bother pinging the host before scanning it. This means that Nmap will always treat the target host(s) as being alive, effectively bypassing the ICMP block; however, it comes with the price of potentially
 taking a very long time to complete the scan (if the host really is dead then Nmap will still be checking and double checking every specified port).

  Here's an example of testing my own Windows computer that has a firewall turned on. When I type just `nmap (my_ip)` it gives me a response that the host is down, but really it could just be a firewall is up and it's blocking any request it's
  receiving that might be unknown. To counter this I can type `-Pn` after Nmap and it will treat it as the host alive and give me the results of all the ports available.
